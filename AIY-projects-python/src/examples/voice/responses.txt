tell me about the project with square
Square teamed up with PCH to provide smart, flexible and cost-effective pack-out of their point-of-sale devices and ship direct to its end-users around the globe —the first in a series of successful collaborations that continue to this day. The customer’s challenge was how to simultaneously improve its time to market, enhance its inventory management and optimize its cash flow. Working together, PCH and its customer established a seamless, highly-flexibly pack-out and fulfillment platform that has optimized time to market and inventory management. PCH continues to provide pack-out and fulfillment services for this customer’s product line. 
tell me about the project with nebia
After raising more than 3 million dollars on Kickstarter in less than a month, a small team was committed to an aggressive launch date for their innovative premium water-saving shower system. During the nine-month program, PCH successfully engineered the shower system to meet its performance requirements while preserving the design firm’s original industrial design objectives. The result is not only the customer's first product, but it is a system that is both beautiful and innovative, a system that reduces water consumption by 70% compared to traditional showers and a system that is currently in high volume production in the United States.
tell me about the project with gopro
GoPro challenged PCH with developing a completely new, efficient, customer friendly and sustainable packaging system for three products and their unique accessories. The final production-ready design involved a two-tier packaging system which included an exterior one-size carton and alternative interior trays, which were made of recycled light-weight plastic to support the different product weights, shapes and sizes to accommodate the various products and accessories.
tell me about the project with l'oreal
PCH worked with a world leading personal care and beauty company to develop the first battery-free wearable electronic UV sensor, taking a hand-made prototype and transforming for large-scale manufacture. Our partner challenged PCH to deliver a manufacturable design for a brand-new technology to be introduced to the consumer market. Like its ground-breaking predecessor, which PCH also design-engineered and manufactured, the sensor accurately detects critical levels of UV exposure, is suitable for high-volume manufacturing and keeps the customer experience at the forefront.
